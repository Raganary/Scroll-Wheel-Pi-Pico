# Scroll-Wheel-Pi-Pico
Simple program used to make a rotary encoder function as a scroll wheel using a raspberry pi pico.
This was just a fun, small project, that I decided to make. 

## Infromation of code
The encoder is programmed with Circuitpython for Pi Pico and uses the Adafruit_hid library.
The class used from the library was the Mouse class that created functions of a mouse scrolling and clicking. 

Note: code is inspired by Cornelius from One Transistor, (https://www.onetransistor.eu/2021/04/media-keys-rpi-pico-circuitpython.html), Thank you for making such a coherent guide.
